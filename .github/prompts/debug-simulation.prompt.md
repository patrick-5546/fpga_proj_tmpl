# Debug a cocotb or Verilator simulation failure

Use this prompt when tests fail, Verilator errors during build, or waveform
inspection is needed.

## Goal

Reproduce the failure, identify whether the root cause is in RTL, tests, or
tooling, and implement the smallest correct fix.

## Debugging flow

1. Reproduce with the canonical command:

   ```sh
   make test
   ```

2. Read the pytest, cocotb, and Verilator output carefully. Preserve the first
   meaningful error rather than chasing later cascading failures.
3. Check whether the failure happened during:
   - Python test collection.
   - Verilator compile/elaboration.
   - cocotb runtime.
   - RTL assertion or expected-value checking.
4. If waveforms are needed, use the generated `build/sim/dump.vcd` file or run:

   ```sh
   make waves
   ```

5. Fix the root cause rather than weakening tests or hiding tool errors.
6. After changes, run the relevant subset of:

   ```sh
   make lint
   make test
   ```

## Things to check

- Python compatibility in `pyproject.toml`, especially cocotb's supported Python
  versions.
- cocotb API changes, such as `unit` versus deprecated `units`.
- Verilator warnings treated as failures by the lint-only flow.
- `SV_SOURCES` in the `Makefile` when new RTL files are added.
- Reset polarity and timing in both RTL and tests.
